# Mc-SatLib
a "library" of various useful commands for minecraft 1.16+

i doubt someone will use this because datapacks are way more useful than in-game command block "coding", but i'm releasing it publically if people want it for some reason

# THIS IS NOT FOR DATAPACKS
**this is for pure in-game command block "programming"**

this enormous command contains various useful and customizable procedures you could use such as:

click detection methods
boolean template
and (hopeffuly) more

# tutorial

1 - copy the command inside one of McSatLib_[version].TXT

2 - open minecraft **in any version above 1.16**

3 - copy the command inside a command block in your creative world

4 - run by either placing redstone or activating in "always active"

5 - enjoy :)
